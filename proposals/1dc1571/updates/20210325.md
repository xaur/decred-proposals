(below is a quote from the renewal proposal)

## Past period expenditure

Overall the contractors have spent total of ~37.1K of 65K. The subdomains breakdown is the following:

- UI/UX ~$27,900 of $35,000
- Identity ~$3,900 of $16,000
- Visual comms. ~$5,300 of $14,000

Total expenditure was ~60% of the [initial proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1dc1571). Most progress was made in UI/UX, as many of the prioritized items were completed. [dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) and [godcr](https://github.com/planetdecred/godcr) received additionally requested work. No work was done on CMS. In terms of the identity subdomain, the largest project being the tutorials had the preliminary milestone completed, and is ready to continue with production over the coming period. Visual branding guidelines and repos were not significantly updated. Requests were made for consistent use of DCR symbol on several major platforms. Summarized log with references of the past period work can be found at: https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/252 (archived [here](20210312.md))

Regarding issues, the initial proposal had an awkward starting time, during the late summer period, this lead to less availability than initially planned. Problems with itemization were noted in CMS.
